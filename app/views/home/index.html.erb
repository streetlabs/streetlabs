     <h2>HOSTED &bull; OPEN &bull; SIMPLE</h2>
     <p><br />
       Our goal is to provide a hosted, open platform: a suite of tools that simplifies the work needed to share research, 
       create online publications or host a conference. <br/><br/>
       Open source. Open to anyone.

     <p>
       A hosted platform that makes formerly inaccessible texts and other artifacts available in an exciting new way to researchers, students, and the general public alike.

     <h3><a href="http://streetmag.org"><span class="street">s<span class="street">treet</span></span><span class="labs">mag</span></a></h3>  
     <p>
       The simplest way to create, host and manage an online publication.<br /> <br />
       Our first journal, INQUIRE, will be online in <i>Fall 2010.</i>

       A couple of years ago being OPEN Source was good enough. We were able to share our work with colleagues and leverage the
       work of the community to bring projects like 
       <a href="http://streetprint.org"><span class="street">s<span class="street">treet</span></span><span class="labs">print</span></a>
       to them.
     </p>
     <p>
       But how OPEN is that? Haven't we learned from Twitter and Facebook that OPEN <i>really</i> means that anyone can get involved. 
       Anyone, without any technical knowledge, should be able to contribute.
     </p>
     <p>
       That is why we started 
       <a href="http://streetlabs.org"><span class="street">s<span class="street">treet</span></span><span class="labs">labs</span></a>. 
       We are creating powerful hosted, platforms that allow us all to focus on our real goals and not Computing Science.
